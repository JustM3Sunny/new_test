# CODY Agent Sample Workflow

This document demonstrates CODY's advanced capabilities through practical examples.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Start CODY:
```bash
python agent.py
```

## üìù Natural Language Commands

### Creating Files

**English:**
```
Create a Python login system with authentication
```

**Hindi/Mixed:**
```
Mujhe ek JavaScript API client chahiye
```

**Technical:**
```
Generate a REST API handler for user management in Python using FastAPI
```

### Code Analysis

```
Analyze the complexity of main.py
```

```
Search for all functions that handle authentication
```

```
Find potential security issues in this codebase
```

### Debugging

```
Debug the TypeError in user_service.py
```

```
Fix the import error in the main module
```

```
Why is my function returning None instead of the expected value?
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Multi-step Workflows

1. **Project Setup:**
```
Create a new Python project structure with:
- main.py as entry point
- config/ directory for settings
- tests/ directory for unit tests
- requirements.txt with common dependencies
```

2. **Code Generation:**
```
Generate a database model for a blog system with:
- User model with authentication
- Post model with relationships
- Comment model with moderation
```

3. **Testing:**
```
Generate comprehensive unit tests for the User model
```

4. **Documentation:**
```
Create API documentation for all endpoints
```

### Context-Aware Operations

CODY maintains context across operations:

```bash
# Add files to context
/add models/user.py
/add controllers/auth.py

# Now CODY understands the relationship
"Refactor the authentication logic to use the User model properly"
```

### Web Search Integration

```
Search for best practices for JWT authentication in Python
```

```
Find examples of async database operations with SQLAlchemy
```

```
Look up the latest security recommendations for API development
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Reference

### File Operations
- `/add <file>` - Add file to context
- `/read <file>` - Read file content
- `/create <file>` - Create new file
- `/edit <file>` - Edit existing file

### Code Operations
- `/analyze <file>` - Analyze code structure
- `/debug <file>` - Debug errors
- `/refactor <file>` - Suggest improvements
- `/test <file>` - Generate tests

### Search Operations
- `/search <query>` - Web search
- `/find <pattern>` - Code search
- `/grep <pattern>` - Text search

### Git Operations
- `/git status` - Show git status
- `/git add <files>` - Stage files
- `/commit <message>` - Commit changes
- `/git branch <name>` - Create branch

### Utility Commands
- `/help` - Show help
- `/context` - Show context usage
- `/clear` - Clear screen
- `/exit` - Exit CODY

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Context Management
- Add relevant files to context before asking for modifications
- Use `/context` to monitor context usage
- Clear context when switching to different projects

### 2. Natural Language
- Be specific about requirements
- Mention the programming language when relevant
- Provide context about the project type

### 3. Iterative Development
- Start with basic structure
- Add features incrementally
- Test each component before moving on

### 4. Error Handling
- Let CODY analyze errors before manual debugging
- Provide full error messages for better analysis
- Use autonomous debugging for common issues

## üîç Example Session

```bash
ü§ñ CODY: How can I help you today?

You: Create a simple web server in Python

ü§ñ CODY: I'll create a simple web server using Flask. Let me generate the code for you.

[Creates app.py with Flask server]

You: Add user authentication to this server

ü§ñ CODY: I'll add JWT-based authentication. Let me enhance the server with login/logout endpoints.

[Modifies app.py to include authentication]

You: Generate tests for the authentication

ü§ñ CODY: I'll create comprehensive tests for the authentication system.

[Creates test_auth.py with unit tests]

You: /run python -m pytest tests/

ü§ñ CODY: Running tests...
[Executes tests and shows results]

You: The login test is failing, can you debug it?

ü§ñ CODY: Let me analyze the test failure and fix the issue.

[Analyzes error, identifies problem, suggests fix]
```

## üöÄ Advanced Scenarios

### Scenario 1: API Development
1. Create FastAPI project structure
2. Define Pydantic models
3. Implement CRUD operations
4. Add authentication middleware
5. Generate OpenAPI documentation
6. Create integration tests

### Scenario 2: Data Processing
1. Analyze CSV data structure
2. Create data cleaning pipeline
3. Implement statistical analysis
4. Generate visualizations
5. Export results to different formats

### Scenario 3: Machine Learning
1. Load and explore dataset
2. Preprocess data
3. Train multiple models
4. Compare performance
5. Deploy best model
6. Create prediction API

## üí° Tips and Tricks

### Performance Optimization
- Use specific file paths to reduce context search time
- Leverage caching for repeated operations
- Enable predictive prefetching for better response times

### Error Prevention
- Let CODY analyze code before running
- Use static analysis for quality checks
- Generate tests early in development

### Collaboration
- Use clear commit messages generated by CODY
- Document code changes automatically
- Share context with team members

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors:**
```
Debug import issues in my Python project
```

**Performance Problems:**
```
Analyze performance bottlenecks in this code
```

**Configuration Issues:**
```
Help me fix the database connection configuration
```

### Getting Help

- Use `/help` for command reference
- Check logs in `cody_agent.log`
- Run `python test_cody.py` to verify setup
- Consult README.md for detailed documentation
